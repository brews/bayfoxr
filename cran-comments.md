## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. Based on feedback from Uwe Ligges' review, in this version I have:

* Corrected title and description in DESCRIPTION, removing redundant "in R" references.

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu & OS X install, R release
* travis-ci: Ubuntu 14.04 (devel, release, and R 3.4.4) and OSX (R release)
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs.
There is one NOTE:  "checking CRAN incoming feasibility - New submission" because this is the packages' first submission.

"coretop", "foraminifera", "SSTs", " planktic" are all correct spellings.

## Downstream dependencies
This package has no downstream dependencies.
