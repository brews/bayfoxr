## Resubmission
This is a second resubmission. Based on feedback from Swetlana Herbrandt, in this version I have:

* Added more description to DESCRIPTION.

* Changed the "SST" acronym to "sea-surface temperature" in DESCRIPTION.

* Reviewer requested paper citation to description. Paper is currently in 
  submission and I will add citation as soon as available.

Following feedback from Uwe Ligges' review in the first submission, in this version I have:

* Corrected title and description in DESCRIPTION, removing redundant "in R" references.

* Promised to add paper citation to description once paper is published.

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu & OS X install, R release
* travis-ci: Ubuntu 14.04 (devel, release, and R 3.4.4) and OSX (R release)
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs.
There is one NOTE:  "checking CRAN incoming feasibility - New submission" because this is the packages' first submission.

"coretop", "foraminifera", "SSTs", " planktic" are all correct spellings.

## Downstream dependencies
This package has no downstream dependencies.
